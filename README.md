# Assignment 6 - Node Web Server

This project is a simple full-stack web application built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **React**, and **MongoDB**.  
It includes two parts — a backend server (Node + Express) and a frontend (React) that interact with each other through API calls.  
The goal of this assignment was to understand how the frontend and backend work together in a full-stack setup.

- **Backend (Render)**

## Overview

The backend is responsible for handling API requests, connecting to MongoDB, and managing data.  
The frontend is developed using React and makes use of **React Hooks (useState, useEffect)** to fetch and display data from the backend.

This project helped me practice:
- Building REST APIs using Node.js and Express  
- Using MongoDB for storing and retrieving data  
- Fetching data from the backend using React hooks  
- Deploying backend on **Render** and frontend on **Netlify**

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/syedabibiamena/Assignment6-node-web-server.git


Step 2 Setup Backend

cd backend
npm install


Then start the backend server:

npm start

http://localhost:4000

Step 3: Setup Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm start


React app should now run at:
http://localhost:3000
